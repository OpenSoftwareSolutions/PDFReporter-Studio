	MongoDB is an open source document-oriented database system developed
	and supported by 10gen. It is part of the NoSQL family of database
	systems. Instead of storing data in tables as is done in a "classical"
	relational database, MongoDB stores structured data as JSON-like
	documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making
	the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and
	faster.
