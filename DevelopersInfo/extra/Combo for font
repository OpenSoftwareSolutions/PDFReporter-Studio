Since the combo popup component need some tweaks to be used for the font selection, it was substituted with a standard combo menu. 
Anyway all the work of the combo popup for the font was manteined even if it's actually unused. 
To restore the combo popup change the occurence of SPFont with SPFontPanelChart and SPFontNameCombo with SPFontNamePopUp.
