	<h1>Welcome to Apache Cassandra</h1>
	The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need
	scalability and high availability without compromising performance.
	Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or
	cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical
	data. Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters
	is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace
	of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. Cassandra's
	ColumnFamily data model offers the convenience of column indexes with
	the performance of log-structured updates, strong support for
	materialized views, and powerful built-in caching.
