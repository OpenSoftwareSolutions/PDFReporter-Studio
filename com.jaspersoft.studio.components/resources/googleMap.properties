latitude = required; floating-point value
longitude = required; floating-point value
title = string value
url = string value. Link to a page or document that will be open when the marker is clicked on. If both url and info window settings are present in a marker definition, the info window takes precedence over the marker URL. See also Info Windows properties
target = string value. The target window/frame to load the marker URL. Allowed values are: \n1) _blank - the URL is loaded into a new window \n2) _parent - the URL is loaded into the parent frame \n3) _self - the URL replaces the current page \n4) _top - the URL replaces any framesets that may be loaded a valid window/frame name
icon = string value (representing the icon URL). See also sub-properties for detailed configuration.

icon.origin.y = integer value representing the vertical position of the image within a sprite, if any, in pixels. Default value is 0.
icon.anchor.x = integer value representing the horizontal position to anchor an image with respect to the location of the marker on the map. Default value is 0.
icon.anchor.y = integer value representing the vertical position to anchor an image with respect to the location of the marker on the map. Default value is 0.
shadow = string value (representing the shadow icon URL). See also sub-properties for detailed configuration.
shadow.url = string value (representing the custom shadow icon URL). If set, it takes precedence over the shadow property.
shadow.width = integer value representing the shadow icon width, in pixels. To be considered, shadow.height must be also set.
shadow.height = integer value representing the shadow icon height, in pixels. To be considered, shadow.width must be also set.
shadow.origin.x = integer value representing the horizontal position of the shadow image within a sprite, if any, in pixels. Default value is 0.
shadow.origin.y = integer value representing the vertical position of the shadow image within a sprite, if any, in pixels. Default value is 0.
shadow.anchor.x = integer value representing the horizontal position to anchor a shadow image with respect to the location of the marker on the map. Default value is 0.
shadow.anchor.y = integer value representing the vertical position to anchor a shadow image with respect to the location of the marker on the map. Default value is 0.
infowindow.content = string value. Represents the content to be displayed in an info window, processed as HTML fragment. Is mandatory for info windows. Empty contents are not processed.
infowindow.latitude = floating-point value. Represents the latitude used to determine the info window position on the map. Neglected for info windows attached to markers.
infowindow.longitude = floating-point value. Represents the longitude used to determine the info window position on the map. Neglected for info windows attached to markers.
infowindow.pixelOffset = integer value. Represents the offset (in pixels) from the tip of the info window to the location on which the info window is anchored.
infowindow.maxWidth = integer value. Specifies the maximum width in pixels of the info window
color = string value representing the color for the default pin icons. This property is taken into account when none of icon or icon.url properties are set. Its value may represent:\n - one of the predefined color names in the following list (see also ColorEnum): black, blue, cyan, darkGray, gray, green, lightGray, magenta, orange, pink, red, yellow, white\n - a valid color hex code (prefixed by #). For instance: #0000FF.\n - the color RGB value.
label = string value representing the label for the default pin icons. This property is taken into account when none of icon or icon.url properties are set. \nNote: Unlike interactive maps, Google static maps require single uppercase alphanumeric character labels. If multiple character labels are set, the JR engine will process the entire label for dynamic maps and only the first character in the label for static maps. Labels are displayed only for default and mid sized markers, small and tiny markers provide no capability to display labels.
cursor = string value
zIndex = integer value
clickable = boolean value
draggable = boolean value
flat = boolean value
optimized = boolean value
raiseOnDrag = boolean value
visible = boolean value
size = predefined string value. This property is considered for static maps only. Specifies the marker size (for the built-in markers only). Allowed values are: mid, tiny, small. If no size is set, the default icon is loaded with its normal size
