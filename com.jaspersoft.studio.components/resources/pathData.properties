latitude=required; floating-point value
longitude=required; floating-point value
style=optional; string value. Represents the name of a given path style (path styles are discussed in the next section of this document). If not provided, the path will be generated using Google default style settings for paths.
strokeColor=optional; string value. Represents the path line color. Named colors are not supported for all Google Maps APIs, so the hex value representation for the color would be more suited in this case.
strokeOpacity=optional; numeric value between 0 and 1 (default). Represents the path line opacity. 1 means 100% opaque, 0 means 100% transparent.
strokeWeight=optional; integer value. Represents the path line weight in pixels. Default value is 5.
fillColor=optional; string value. Considered for polygons only, represents the fill color for the polygonal contour. Also named colors are not recommended in this case.
fillOpacity=optional; numeric value between 0 (default) and 1. Considered for polygons only, represents the fill opacity for the polygonal contour. 1 means 100% opaque, 0 means 100% transparent.
isPolygon=optional; boolean value. If set to true the last point in the path is connected to the first point in order to form a polygon (closed path). Default value is false
clickable=optional; boolean value. If set to true, the path object may handle mouse events. Defaults to true.
editable=optional; boolean value. If set to true, the user may edit the path using the control points shown along the path line. Defaults to false.
draggable=optional; boolean value. If set to true, the user may drag the path contour over the map. Defaults to false.
geodesic=optional; boolean value. Defines the mode of dragging. If set to true, edges of the polygon are interpreted as geodesic and will follow the curvature of the Earth when the path contour is dragged. Defaults to false.
visible=optional; boolean value. If set to true, the path is visible on the map. Defaults to true.
zIndex=optional; integer value. Represents the zIndex compared to other path elements
