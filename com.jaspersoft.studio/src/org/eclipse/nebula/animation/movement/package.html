<h2>Package Specification</h2>

Contains both easing and non easing equations:

<p>An easing equation goes from an initial value to a target value

<ul>
	<li>Bounce</li>
	<li>Elastic</li>
	<li>Expo</li>
	<li>Linear</li>
	<li>Quart</li>
</ul>


<p>Other equations have custom animation path. (from 0 to 0 with
values going up to 255 for instance). These movements are :</p>
<ul>
	<li>SinusDecreraseVariation</li>
	<li>SinusVariation</li>
</ul>

<p>Easing movements contains 'In' or/and 'Out' in their names. </p><ul>
<li>'In'
means that the major part of the movement is applied right at the
