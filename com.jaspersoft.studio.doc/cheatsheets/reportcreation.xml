   <intro>
      <description>
         In this cheatsheet, we will see the basics of how to design a report. In the report creation process there are three main steps: creating a data source or a database connection used to fill the report, designing the report layout and running the report. To keep things simple, this tutorial uses a sample database included in the installation of Jaspersoft Studio. The data to print is retrieved using a SQL query defined during the creation of the datasource.
