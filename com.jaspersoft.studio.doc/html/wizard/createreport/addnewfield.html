        	You may discover that you need to add more fields from the data source after the report was created. You can add fields
        	to an existing report without creating an entirely new report. To add fields to an already created report, select the main
        	node of the report from the outline view (in this example is named "coffee"). From the properties tab press the
        	button Edit query, filter and sort option, as shown in the following figure
        </p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="N40011"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Edit Query Button</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

        <p>
        	In the dialog that appears, you can specify a new query and by clicking the button Read Fields and then "OK".
        	All the fields discovered are added as new fields in the report. Note that if the new query discovers fewer fields than the
        	ones used in the existing report, the fields that are not included the new query will be removed from the report. An
        	example can be seen in the following figure:
        </p>
        <div class="figure"><a name="N40028"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Query Editor Wizard</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

        <p>
        	As you can see, we selected only the fields ORDERID and CUSTOMERID, so any field previously added to the report that is
        	not included in these two will be removed. This dialog is very powerful - from here, you can change the data source, add,
        	remove and reorder the fields discovered by the new query.
