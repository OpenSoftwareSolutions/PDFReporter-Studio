		<para>
			In this view you can see and manage data adapters, JasperReports Server connections, and resources. The toolbar in this view contains two actions:
			<itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a Data Adapter
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a JasperReports Server connection.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		</para>
		<para>
			Management of tree objects is done with a context menu.
		</para>
		<para>
			Inside
			<emphasis>Data Adapters</emphasis>
			tree item we can see all the data adapters stored in Eclipse preferences at the instance level. In the context menu, we have actions to create, edit, delete, and duplicate data adapters. Data
			adapters can be stored in the filesystem inside Eclipse projects. There are actions to import and export data adapters to or from Eclipse preferences.
		</para>
		<tip>
			<para>
				It's better to store data adapters inside the projects, because reports may be deployed elsewhere.

		<para>
			From the context menu inside
			<emphasis>Servers</emphasis>
			you can create, edit, duplicate, or delete a server connection. To see objects inside a server connection, click on the arrow to the left of connection name.
			After a few seconds (depending on your
			connection and server communication speed) the node is populated
			with a list of JasperReports Server objects, such as folders, Report Units, connections, reports, etc.
		</para>
		<para>
			When you right-click on an object, depending on resource type, we can see actions that are possible for that type of resource.
			Common actions are cut, copy, paste, and refresh. To open a dialog
			where we can see or edit the object, use the
			<guimenu>Properties</guimenu>
			menu item.
		</para>
		<para>For ReportUnits, there is an action to run this reports on a server and view them in Jaspersoft Studio.</para>
		<tip>
			<para>
				Cut, copy and paste actions work inside the same server connection. Currently it's not possible to copy resources between different servers.
